        <h2><q> A truth that’s told with bad intent

            <em>Poet, painter, engraver, and visionary</em> William Blake worked to bring about a change both in the
            social order
            and in the minds of men. Though in his lifetime his work was largely neglected or dismissed, he is now
            considered one of the leading lights of English poetry, and his work has only grown in popularity. In his
            Life of William Blake (1863) Alexander Gilchrist warned his readers that Blake <i><b>“neither wrote nor drew
                    for
                    the many, hardly for work’y-day men at all, rather for children and angels; himself ‘a divine
                    child,’ whose
                    playthings were sun, moon, and stars, the heavens and the earth.”</b></i> Yet Blake himself believed
            that his
            writings were of national importance and that they could be understood by a majority of his peers. Far from
            being an isolated mystic, Blake lived and worked in the teeming metropolis of London at a time of great
            social and political change that profoundly influenced his writing. In addition to being considered one of
            the most visionary of English poets and one of the great progenitors of English Romanticism, his visual
            artwork is highly regarded around the world.

            Blake was born on November 28, 1757. Unlike many well-known writers of his day, Blake was born into a family
            of moderate means. His father, James, was a hosier, and the family lived at 28 Broad Street in London in an
            unpretentious but “respectable” neighborhood. In all, seven children were born to James and Catherine Wright
            Blake, but only five survived infancy. Blake seems to have been closest to his youngest brother, Robert, who
            died young. <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-blake">Read More</a>
