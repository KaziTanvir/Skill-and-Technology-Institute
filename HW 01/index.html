        Rintrah roars and shakes his fires in the burdened air; <br>
        Hungry clouds swag on the deep. <br>
        <br>
        Once meek, and in a perilous path, <br>
        The just man kept his course along <br>
        The vale of death. <br>
        Roses are planted where thorns grow, <br>
        And on the barren heath <br>
        Sing the honey bees. <br>
            <br>
        Then the perilous path was planted: <br>
        And a river and a spring <br>
        On every cliff and tomb;<br>
        And on the bleached bones <br>
        Red clay brought forth. <br>

        Till the villain left the paths of ease, <br>
        To walk in perilous paths, and drive <br>
        The just man into barren climes. <br>
<br>
        Now the sneaking serpent walks <br>
        In mild humility, <br>
        And the just man rages in the wilds <br>
        Where lions roam. <br>
            <br>
        Rintrah roars and shakes his fires in the burdened air; <br>
        Hungry clouds swag on the deep. <br>
